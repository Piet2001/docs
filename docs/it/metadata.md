# Collecting of Metadata

By using `LSSM` the user accepts that we do collect metadata. The following data is stored: `User ID`, `Username`, `User Buildings`, `User Browser`, `Last time the script was executed`, `activated Plugins`, `game origin` & `LSSM Version`.

These data helps to improve the extension as well as a reference for the development of existing and future modules.

**The user can revoke the collection of this data any time by messaging a developer**.
All collected data will be deleted and no more data will be collected.
