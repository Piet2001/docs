::: warning "Mapkit" Map support

There are a few modules that are not supported when MapKit is selected. This is because MapKit lacks some functionalities.
For the same reason, there are also small restrictions for MapKit users on the game itself.

`Center-Map`, `Clock`, `LS-Heatmap`, `Overview`, `Request Transport in Map`, and `Station Status` do not work with the Mapkit card type.

## Settings
All settings for enabled modules is located here. As such, you can only change settings of enabled modules.

Settings can be exported or imported, allowing you to share your settings, or transfer settings to different devices.
