## About the LSSM
LSS MANAGER V3 (LSSM) is an extension for [missionchief.com](https://missionchief.com), [missionchief.co.uk](https://missionchief.co.uk) and [missionchief-australia.com](https://missionchief-australia.com).

LSSM is an extension which allows you to install different plugins to your game. All functions from LSSM are modular, so you can decide which to activate.

Plugins which are not activated will not be loaded, increasing performance.
